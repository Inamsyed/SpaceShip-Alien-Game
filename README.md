An Implementation of the Alien Spaceship Game . I created this interactive game using Processing . Processing is a flexible software sketchbook which provides users with GUI for simple compilation of the programs written in processing . Utilising my java skills , I created multiples classes for each of the aspects of the Game . This include the Player(spaceship) , the enemies (aliens) , the bullets , the bomb and lastly the messages displayed at the end .
